  <h2>About photography and myself</h2>
  <h3>I was born on 2000 October. I am from Taiwan and has been there for my whole entire life  I came tuntilo the US. I am always and still are interested in art. I started off my university major on ceramics. I've learnt a lot on how artists make bowls, mugs and all sorts of different vessels out of clay. After the first semester I've been a little miserable on what major I should focus on and what really attracts my attention. I've started my second semester on photography, which I love and wanting to dig more into it in the future. I did some very sucessful shots in my photography class and I also posed as a model for other photographers. </h3>
